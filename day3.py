#*logical operators

#Unlike other programming languages python uses keywords and, or and not for logical operators. Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
"""
input1 = input("Enter Hello:");
input2  = input("Enter World:");
#returns true if both statements are true
print(input1 == "Hello" and input2 == "World")
#returns true if either one of the statement is true
print(input1 == "Hello" or input2 == "World");
#reverses the result of a condition
print(not(False))
#double negation
print(not not False) # true false
print(not not True) # false true
