🗓️ Phase 1: Python & Image Handling (Weeks 1–3)
Week 1: Python Essentials
Variables, control flow, functions, lists/dicts

File I/O: reading/writing images

Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming + Libraries
Classes & modules

pip usage; install OpenCV, NumPy

Week 3: OpenCV Basics
Load/display/resize images

Convert color formats (RGB/grayscale/H S V)

Basic filters (blur, edge detection)

🎯 Mini-project: Detect edges or color patterns from leaf images

📷 Phase 2: Image Processing & Disease Indicators (Weeks 4–5)
Week 4: Preprocessing & Segmentation
Color segmentation in HSV

Contour detection for isolating leaves

Week 5: Feature Extraction
Extract color, texture, shape features

Optional: use OpenCV to calculate disease severity (e.g., spot area ratio)

🎯 Mini-project: Segment leaf and highlight suspect diseased patches

🤖 Phase 3: Machine Learning Model (Weeks 6–8)
Week 6: Intro to CNNs & Keras/TensorFlow
Learn basics: layers, activations, loss, optimizers

Save model (e.g., .h5 file)

🎯 Mini-project: Train model to classify healthy vs infected vs dead leaves

🌐 Phase 4: App Integration (Weeks 9–11)
Week 9: Choose a Framework
Streamlit: faster, interactive 
github.com
github.com

Flask or FastAPI: good for learning APIs

Week 10: Develop Upload → Inference Pipeline
Build front-end to upload image

Load model; pass image → preprocessing → predict

Week 11: Polish UI & Testing
Display leaf and predicted label (“Healthy”, “Infected”, “Dead”)

Add confidence scores and simple styling

🚀 Phase 5: Optional Deployment & Enhancement (Week 12+)
Deploy using Heroku/Render or Hugging Face Spaces
